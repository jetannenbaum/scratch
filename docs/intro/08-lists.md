# Draw A Square With Different Color Sides
We can use a variable called a list to hold our color offsets, then set the pen color using an offset from the list.

First, we need to a list as a variable

![make a list](../img/makeList.jpg)

Just like any other variable, we'll give our list a name

![name the list](../img/nameList.jpg)

Once we have our list, we want to make sure it starts out empty, each time we start our program.  Then we can add our color offsets to the list.

![create list](../img/createList.jpg)
